# LIFE SPAN PREDICTOR: ALGORITHMS, FRACTALS, AND GRAPHS

There are many files in this repository. Each key file has a separate set of instructions to run them. Please see below for each respective set of instruction. 

To run or read any of our code, please first follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository
2. Generate an API key at https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys
3. Navigate to the code folder. This is where all relevant, updated code is stored.
4. Locally make a .env file and write GOOGLE_API_KEY = {fill this in with your API key, remove curly braces}

(WARNING: If at any point there is an error that you have run out of API credits, please generate a new API key and rerun our program. We recomend generating a new API key for every run, to prevent it running out in the middle of a trial.)


To run our interactive model that generates the expected lifespan based on user input parameters, please follow the steps below:
1. Navigate to code/ogmodel.py
2. Run the code locally


To generate the fractals, please follow the steps below: 
1. Based on your desired fractal, navigate to code/fractal_julia_set.py OR code/fractal_mandelbrot_survival.py OR code/fractal_network.py OR code/fractal_survivalprob_vs_resources.py OR code/fractal_tree_of_survival_prob.py
2. Run the code locally


To generate the graphs, please follow the steps below: 
1. Navigate to code/graphs.py
2. Run the code locally


We hope you enjoy learning about your remaining life span!
